      " |      num_validations (int): number of cross validations to perform. 0 for just train/test on best split.\n",
      " |          Possible confusion: num_validations is the number of validations to perform *after* the first eval segment, so totally eval/validations will be this + 1.\n",

      " |          'seasonal' most similar indexes\n",
      " |          'seasonal n' for example 'seasonal 364' would test all data on each previous year of the forecast_length that would immediately follow the training data.\n",

      " |          0.5 with a forecast length of 10 would mean 5 training points are mandated, for a total of 15 points.\n",
      " |          Useful in (unrecommended) cases where forecast_length > training length.\n",
      " |      remove_leading_zeroes (bool): replace leading zeroes with NaN. Useful in data where initial zeroes mean data collection hasn't started yet.\n",
      " |      prefill_na (str): value to input to fill all NaNs with. Leaving as None and allowing model interpolation is recommended.\n",
      " |          None, 0, 'mean', or 'median'. 0 may be useful in for examples sales cases where all NaN can be assumed equal to zero.\n",
      " |      introduce_na (bool): whether to force last values in one training validation to be NaN. Helps make more robust models.\n",
      " |          defaults to None, which introduces NaN in last rows of validations if any NaN in tail of training data. Will not introduce NaN to all series if subset is used.\n",
      " |          if True, will also randomly change 20% of all rows to NaN in the validations\n",

      " |          {\"fillna\": \"median\", \"transformations\": {}, \"transformation_params\": {}}\n",
      " |          This will change data used in model inputs for fit and predict, and for accuracy evaluation in cross validation!\n",

      " |          This is only checked after the end of each generation, so only offers an 'approximate' timeout for searching. It is an overall cap for total generation search time, not per generation.\n",
